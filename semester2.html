            <p><b>1/19/24</b> - This is my first journal entry!</p>
            <br><p>in the past week, we've started a new project where we have to make a car. there was a choice between an arduino car and a mousetrap car and i chose the mousetrap one bc mechanical engineering is pretty cool. we also had a quiz which i think i did ok on.</p>
