        </p>Throughout the past week, we've done a lot in Engineering class. It took a while to get everything started but once we did, everyone was able to create our own website. We were also able to go through a few slides about safety and the engineering process and start our first challenge, which we failed miserably at. This weekend, I'm planning to practice some new songs on electric guitar. My dad also got a new PS5 so I'm able to bring his PS4 to my mom's house.
