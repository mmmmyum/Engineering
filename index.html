            <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/dragon-roll/">My Favorite Website</a>
        <p>Throughout the past week, we've done a lot in Engineering class. It took a while to get everything started but once we did, everyone was able to create our own website. We were also able to go through a few slides about safety and the engineering process and start our first challenge, where we had to navigate a marble to a bucket with pipes. Even though our group failed miserably, it was still probably my favorite part of the week. This weekend, I'm planning to practice some new songs on electric guitar. My dad also got a new PS5 so I'm able to bring his PS4 to my mom's house.</p>

            <b><p>9/1/23</b> - This is my second journal entry</p>
            <br> I've learned that it's important to save our progress on our website. I was adjusting the size of my images and when I found the right size, I closed the tab but forgot to save, meaning I had to readjust everything. This week, we started our next project. We have to make a Rube Goldberg machine, which starts off small but causes a huge chain reaction to complete a goal. Our challenge for this week was involving Tinkercad. We had to create our favorite home appliance on the website and the winner got a KitKat. I ended up making a toaster which a lot of people did.</p>
